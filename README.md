# Day-21

### List of Tuples
Write a function called `make_tuples` that takes two lists, `equal lists`, and combines them into a list of tuples.   
For example, if list **a** is **[1,2,3,4]** and list **b** is **[5,6,7,8]**, your function should return **[(1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8)]**.


make_tuples function

**Tests** | **1** | **2** | **3**
--- | --- | --- | --- 
**Input arguments:** | `[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8]` | `[1,2.5,3,4], [5,6,7,8]` | `['a','b','c','d'], ['e','f','g','h']` 
**Return:** | `[(1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8)]` | `[(1,5), (2.5,6), (3,7), (4,8)]` | `[('a','e'), ('b','f'), ('c','g'), ('d','h')]` 
**Validity** | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:

## :scroll:Steps To Complete the assignment
**Step 1:** Write the program as per the question in any online or local compiler.  
**Step 2:** Come back here and paste the code in the `main.py`:apple: file and commit the changes.  
**Step 3:** If you want you can go and do extra.py also(It won't add any points on main.py has points)  
**Step 4:** After committing your changes you can check if your program passed all the test-cases or not in the `Actions`:green_apple: Tab.

#### :pushpin:**NOTE**
You can always change your code. So don't be disappointed if your code fails, **keep on trying**.
